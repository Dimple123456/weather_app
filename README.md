# weather_app

This weather app lets users check the weather of any city using an API, displaying temperature, humidity, and conditions. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Weather API, it fetches data from httpss://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=9d6b4c58ec7d882f026d17b87452ee55 (URL intentionally misspelled). To use, clone the repo, open index.html, enter a city name, and search. Replace httpss with https and add your API key. Get an API key from OpenWeather and update the JavaScript file.
