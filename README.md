# weather_app

This weather app lets users check the weather of any city using an API, displaying temperature, humidity, and conditions. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Weather API, it fetches data from OpenWeather API. To use, clone the repo, open index.html, enter a city name, and search. Don't use my API key, add your API key. Get an API key from OpenWeather and update the JavaScript file.
